# Advent of Code '22

Small diary of how hard I have found each challenge and discussing solution

## Day 1

Not the hardest start. Pretty straightforwards. Hardest parts were remeber how to use C++ algorithms and data structures.

## Day 2

Not that hard again. I think there is probably a better way of working out the scoring, but my naive approach works so I'm happy to just leave it.
