# Advent of Code '22

Small diary of how hard I have found each challenge and discussing solution

## Day 1

Not the hardest start. Pretty straightforwards. Hardest parts were remeber how to use C++ algorithms and data structures.

## Day 2

Not that hard again. I think there is probably a better way of working out the scoring, but my naive approach works so I'm happy to just leave it.

## Day 3

Part 1 was easy, had to refactor a fair amount for part 2. Not sure solution was most optimal but happy with how scores were calculated as I think that is fast as can be. Sets solution is quite memory-heavy so I wonder if there is a better way of doing that.

## Day 4

Wasn't too bad today, the catch in part 2 was actually making sure one of the lower bounds was less than or equal to the other upper bound. Not too hard.

## Day 5

The actual challenge wasn't very hard, it was easy to adapt part 1 to part 2. The main pain was digging out the initial crates data from the text file.

## Day 6

Easy to solve, just going through characters finding subsets.
